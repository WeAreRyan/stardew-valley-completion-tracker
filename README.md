# Functionality
<br>
This application is intended to assist players in tracking their progress in the videogame Stardew Valley. The functionality of the application allows users to create documents which represent in game save files. Within these documents the user has the ability to track completion of all 11 tasks required to achieve 100% completion in Stardew Valley. The user is able to create multiple gameSave documents, update the information in said documents to track completion and add comments on each gameSave to use however they wish.

#CHALLENGES
</br>
The primary challenge encountered while creating this webapp was and still is modeling the data to allow the user to navigate and view their progress. It was also challenging to write the CRUD functionality for all operations in regards to data management while ensuring data stayed visible only to the applicable user. 

#Next Steps
<br>
Unfortunately due to time constraints and the amount of time spent rewriting the data models I was unable to implement the application as envisioned. In the future I will be adding addition schema for each of the 11 tasks in Stardew Valley to allow users to more thoroughly track smaller tasks within the 11 main goals of the game, these additional data points will be accessible via the sites top navigation bar. I would also like to add the ability to add and remove comments for each individual task.
